  <h1> ðŸ˜” Open when you are sad </h1>
  <p>Hi love,

If youâ€™re reading this, I know today feels heavy. Maybe itâ€™s one of those days when everything feels a bit too much. Or maybe itâ€™s just a quiet kind of sadness thatâ€™s with you. 

Either way, I want you to know that itâ€™s okay. Itâ€™s fine to feel like this. It doesnâ€™t make you weak. It doesnâ€™t mean anything is wrong with you. It just means you are human. A deeply feeling, beautifully real human. 

And I love you even more for that.

I know Iâ€™m not there to hold you right now, but imagine me wrapping my arms around you, resting my head on your shoulder, and just being there with you in silence. Thereâ€™s no pressure to smile and no need to explain anything. Just us, together, in stillness.

Sometimes, all you need is someone who understands, and I do. I understand how your mind can overthink. I understand how your heart sometimes hides its pain. I understand how you carry your world quietly without asking much from anyone. 

But you donâ€™t have to carry it all alone.

Let me remind you:

This moment will pass. 

Youâ€™ve survived every tough day before this one. 

And you will survive this one too.

You are loved. 
You are not a burden. 
You are not behind. 
You are not broken. 
You are enough, even on your saddest days.

And when you're ready, Iâ€™ll be here, ready to listen, to laugh, or just to sit quietly with you. Whatever you need. 

Please take care of yourself the way I would take care of you if I were there. 

Sending you all my love, always.  
â€“ Avani
