  <h1>🌧️ Open When You're Anxious</h1>
  <p>Hi love,</p>
  <p>If your heart is racing, your thoughts are spiraling, or everything just feels a little too much — I want you to pause here with me.</p>
  <p>Breathe. In and out. Slowly. One more time. You’re okay. You’re safe. You’re not alone — even if it feels like it right now.</p>
  <p>Whatever you're feeling is valid. You don’t have to fight it or fix it instantly. Just let it pass through gently, like clouds in a sky that never forgets how to be blue again.</p>
  <p>I believe in you. You’ve made it through your hardest days before, and I know you’ll get through this one too. I'm always just one call, one text, one thought away. Let my love wrap around you like a soft blanket right now.</p>
  <p>You are loved. You are held. You are more than enough.</p>
