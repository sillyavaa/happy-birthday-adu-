  <h1>🤍 Open After We Fight</h1>
  <p>Hi love,</p>
  <p>I know if you're reading this, we probably said things we didn’t mean. Maybe we misunderstood each other, maybe we just got overwhelmed. Whatever it was — I'm sorry. Not just for what was said, but for any way I may have made you feel hurt, distant, or unloved.</p>
  <p>Fighting doesn't mean we’re broken. It means we care — enough to feel things deeply, enough to fight *for* each other even when it gets messy.</p>
  <p>I love you — even when I’m mad, even when we don’t agree, even when it’s hard. My love doesn’t disappear when things get rough. In fact, I think we grow stronger by choosing to come back to each other after the storm.</p>
  <p>Let’s remember what we’re fighting *for*, not just what we’re fighting about. We’re on the same team. Always.</p>
  <p>I’m here when you're ready. With softness, with patience, and with love — always.</p>
  <p>– Avani 🕊️</p>
