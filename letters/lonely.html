  <h1>ðŸ’Œ Open When You're Feeling Lonely</h1>
  <p>Hey you, yes you... my favorite potato chip in the bag ðŸ¥”âœ¨</p>
  <p>If you're feeling alone right now, I want you to remember one very important thing: I'm right there with you â€” maybe not physically (curse this long-distance nonsense), but in all the little ways that matter.</p>
  <p>In the way the sun hits your face in the morning. In your favorite song randomly playing. In the way your pillow somehow feels like my arms (okay, not <em>exactly</em> â€” Iâ€™m way softer, obviously ðŸ˜Œ).</p>
  <p>Itâ€™s okay to feel lonely. That feeling is real. But I promise â€” youâ€™re never alone in this world. Not as long as Iâ€™m here annoying you with bad jokes, random check-ins, and aggressively sending memes until you smile again. ðŸ˜¤ðŸ“²</p>
  <p>So if your heart feels a little too quiet today, let mine hum for the both of us. Close your eyes and imagine me squishing your cheeks, telling you how ridiculously cute you are and how lucky I am to call you mine.</p>
  <p>Weâ€™re under the same sky, looking at the same moon. Just imagine it whispering, "They're thinking of you right now." And I am â€” always.</p>
  <p class="signature">Forever on your team â€” Avani ðŸ§¸ðŸ’˜</p>
