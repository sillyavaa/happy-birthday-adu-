  <h1> HAPPY BIRTHDAYYYY ~(￣▽￣)~*</h1>
  <p>
  Dear 18-Year-Old You,

I know birthdays haven’t felt exciting for you lately. It’s hard to celebrate when you feel stuck between "I should’ve done more" and "why does time move so fast?"

But today, I’m not here to list your accomplishments or tell you what you “should’ve” achieved by now.

I just want to remind you of something simple, but true:

You made it. You got through every quiet night you didn’t talk about. You dealt with the pressure, the self-doubt, and growing up too soon. You made it to 18, and that alone is worth celebrating.

You’ve become someone kind, thoughtful, and reliable, even when things aren’t perfect. That means more to me than any grade, goal, or resume ever could.

I’m proud of you, not because you’ve done everything, but because you keep trying, even on the tough days. I’m proud because you feel deeply, care quietly, and love fiercely, especially when you think no one sees it.

But I see it. I see you.

So this year, let’s not focus on what the world expects of 18. Let’s hold onto the boy you’ve been, the man you’re becoming, and the love you carry so gently inside you.

You’re not behind. You’re just growing. I feel lucky to walk with you as you do.

Happy birthday, love. I’ll celebrate you, not just today, but every day. Even from far away, I’m always with you.

With all my heart,  
Avani
